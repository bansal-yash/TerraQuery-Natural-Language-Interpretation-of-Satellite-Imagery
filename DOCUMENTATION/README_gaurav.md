## General Purpose
Personal workspace for experimental band classifier development. Contains Jupyter notebooks for PyTorch-based satellite image classification experiments and dataset categorization.

## Files

### `band_classifier_pytorch_final_final.ipynb`
Final implementation notebook for band/type classifier training and evaluation using PyTorch ResNet50 architecture.

### `categorize.ipynb`
Notebook for exploring and categorizing satellite imagery datasets by type or metadata.

### `categorize_folder.ipynb`
Automated script notebook for batch categorization and organization of image folders by classification results.

### `inference.ipynb`
Interactive notebook for running inference experiments and visualizing classification results on test images.

### `inference2.ipynb`
Extended inference notebook with additional visualization and analysis capabilities for model predictions.

### `corrected.ipynb`
Notebook containing bug fixes or corrections to earlier classification experiments.

### `type_classifier.py`
Standalone Python script version of the band classifier for command-line usage with ResNet50 model.

### `checkpoint/`
Directory storing trained model checkpoints from experimental training runs.

### `dataset/`
Local dataset storage for training and testing the band classifier.
