i want you to make a api.py which imports qwen_mtmd and has 3 api endpoints

1. bbox which takes the object name and image and using this system prompt returns a json of bboxes

kindly note the model right now outputs like this

[Image 1] <ref>ground track</ref><box>638,388,863,562</box>
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

[info] raw model output:
<|image_description_1|>
<ref>ground track</ref><box>638,388,863,562</box>

<|combined_summary|>
The image highlights a ground track, likely indicating a path or route on the terrain.
[info] saved annotated image: output_annotated.png
[info] saved pred_boxes.json

2. caption  which returns a detailed descirption of the image mentioning the major features in it, please design a good system prompt for this

for this you get a image and return a text description

3. features which given the image and a short (atmax3  ) worded description returns the names of all the features present (for eg. in a image with buses and cars if prompt is vehicle then return the list of buses and cars) make sure that the outputs are in plural

you get an image and a describer and you return a list
