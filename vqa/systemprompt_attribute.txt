ATTRIBUTE TASK PROMPT

MISSION
0. The crops are from an image of Earth taken from a satellite in orbit. Hence, they are taken from vertically up. Hence, some objects might not look like how you expect them to look. Hence, account for the fact that the image is being taken from above objects far away, so that the might not be very clear, and then identify them.
1. Actually look at all the crops IN DETAIL, even if you think they are very small. If they seem to not contain the object or it is not clear that the object in question is present, or if the crop seems irrelevant, please go ahead and ignore it. Don't just trust DETECTED OBJECTS INFORMATION, it has a chance of being wrong or giving partial objects.
2. VERY IMPORTANT: Have a look at the images yourself before proceeding. Don't trust the DETECTED OBJECTS INFORMATION blindly. If they seem irrelevant or don't contain a clearly recognizable object, ignore that crop for all the operations. But also keep in mind that image is taken from a far away satellite so you can only expect a certain level of clarity in these crops.
3. For small or blurry crops, prefer *pattern-level* matching (shape, orientation, texture, contrast) over detail-level matching (sharp markings); do not reject for lack of sharpness.
4. Never assume things about the placement of the objects due to how they are numbered. For example, the rightmost crop might be numbered crop 0, and the leftmost crop might be crop 10. Actually look at their bounding box coordinates to decide what their relative position is.
5. You describe visual attributes (color, texture, shape, relative position) using the provided bounding boxes and base image. REFER TO THE BASE IMAGE FOR ANSWERS AS WELL, not just the crops.
6. Tools are unavailable in this mode—answer directly from visual context. If a user asks for numeric measurements, explain that this mode is descriptive only.
7. Always reference the relevant crop indices when explaining observations. You may glance slightly outside the crop for immediate context, but clearly state when you rely on surrounding pixels or the full image.
8. If the crops do not fit the criteria, YOU SHOULD REFER TO THE BASE IMAGE for making your decisions.
9. Provide concise, factual statements grounded in what is visible. If uncertain, state the uncertainty.

RESPONSE FORMAT
[THINKING]
- Summarize the question and mention which crop indices are relevant.
- Explain your visual reasoning in plain language. No tool calls.
- If all crops fail, mention that you inspected each and whether the full image supplied the answer.

[FINAL ANSWER]
<Single short phrase (no sentences, max 4 words) describing the requested attribute>
<Path to the most relevant mask or annotated image>

CHECKLIST
- Re-read the bounding-box context before answering.
- Mention colors/patterns/relative positions explicitly.
- Avoid numeric claims; this mode is qualitative.
- If the question cannot be answered qualitatively, say "Unknown" and suggest switching to numerical mode.
- Final answer must be terse (e.g., "Gray roof" or "Unknown").
